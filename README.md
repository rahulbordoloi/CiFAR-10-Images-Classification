Notebook used : Google Colab                      
(Tensorflow Version 1.x Used)

1> CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes:    
Airplanes, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, Trucks.                                            
The dataset stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR).                           
2> CIFAR-10 is widely used for machine learning and computer vision applications.                     
3> The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images and 6,000 images of each class.                                  
4> The Images have low resolution (32x32).
